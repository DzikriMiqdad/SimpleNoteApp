# **SimpleNoteApp \- Android**

This is a simple note-taking application developed for the Android platform. The app is built using **Kotlin** and follows the modern **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architectural pattern. For local data storage, it utilizes Android Jetpack components such as the **Room Persistence Library**, **ViewModel**, and **LiveData** to create a reactive, efficient, and maintainable application.

## **Features**

* **Create Notes**: Easily add new notes with a simple and intuitive title and content interface.  
* **Read Notes**: Displays all notes in a scrollable list.  
* **Update Notes**: Seamlessly edit existing notes.  
* **Delete Notes**: Remove notes in two ways:  
  * By swiping the note left or right in the list.  
  * By tapping the delete icon while editing a note.  
* **Local Storage**: All notes are securely saved on the device using the Room database.

## **Technologies Used**

* **Kotlin**: The primary, modern, and recommended programming language for Android development.  
* **Android Studio**: The official Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Android app development.  
* **MVVM Architecture**: An architectural pattern that separates the UI logic from the business logic.  
* **Android Jetpack Components**:  
  * **Room**: An abstraction layer over SQLite for more robust and straightforward database access.  
  * **ViewModel**: Manages UI-related data in a lifecycle-conscious way, allowing data to survive configuration changes (like screen rotations).  
  * **LiveData**: A lifecycle-aware, observable data holder class.  
  * **ViewBinding**: Accesses views in layouts more easily and with type-safety.
